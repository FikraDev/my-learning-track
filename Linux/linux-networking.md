# **Networking in Linux**

## Networking Basics

- IP address
- Subnet Mask
- Gateway
- Static vs DHCP
- Interface
- Interface MAC Address - 12 dash seperated characters.  The first six (6) characters uniquely identify the manufacturer of the device.  the other six identify that Network Interface Controller (NIC).

## Must Know Configuration Files

- The must know interface configuration files are:
  - **/etc/nsswitch.conf** -  used to configure which services are to be used to determine information such as hostnames, password files, and group files.
  - **/etc/hosts** - this file contains the Internet Protocol (IP) host names and addresses for the local host and other hosts in the Internet network.  It is used to map hostnames to IP addresses.  It acts like a local DNS server.  It is located in the /etc directory which means that in order to edit it you have to use elevated privleges(sudo/root).
    - the first entries in the file are normally dedicated to the host machine.
  - **/etc/hostname** - this is the local hostname configuration file.  It is used to configure the nameof the local system.
  - **/etc/sysconfig/network** - specifies routing and host information for all network interfaces. **(Rhel derived variants)**
  - **/etc/network/interfaces** - allows for the definition of static and dynamic IP addresses for the interfaces, setup routing information and default gateways, masquerading network bonding and more.
    - the default interfaces file will only have:

    > auto lo - auto starts the interface at boot
    > iface lo inet loopback` - calls the network interface

  - **/etc/resolv.conf** - this file defines how the your linux instance uses DNS to resolve host names.  It basically lists the DNS names that the host system uses for resolution.  It normally contains the DNS generated by DHCP.

### How to Setup an Interface with DHCP by Editing the /etc/network/intefaces file

> auto InterfaceName  
> allow-hotplug InterfaceName  
> iface InterfaceName inet dhcp  

  Where allow-hotplug will start the interface upon event detection.

## NetworkManager

- NetworkManager is a utility that is is used to manage both network and network interface cards in Linux.
- It is an addition to the previously mentioned config files and can be disabled if necessary.  Both editing the config files and using NetworkManager do the same thing so the choice is yours as to which one you are more comfortable using.
- NetworkManager has several related utilities that it uses.  These are:

  - IP utility
  - nmcli - NetworkManager Command Line
  - nmtui - NetworkManager Text User Interface (text based configuration interface)

- One of the more notable changes with NetworkManager is instead of using `ifconfig` to get network information, we now invoke the IP utility and use `ip a`.
- ***On Rhel derived linux variants, the NetworkManager stores new network profiles in keyfile format in the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ directory.***

### Configuring Network Settings With NetworkManager

- to check if NetworkManager is running on your system: `systemctl status NetworkManager`
- to locate the network config files for NetworkManager: `cd /etc/NetworkManager`
- to locate the connecting settings: `cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`
